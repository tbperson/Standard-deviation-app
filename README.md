## Features

- Users can input the number of values (n) for their dataset.
- A table is dynamically generated to input the dataset.
- After inputting the data, users can calculate the standard deviation.
- The application displays the mean and standard deviation.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input the number of values (n).
3. Enter the dataset into the table.
4. Click on the "Calculate the standard deviation" button.
5. The mean and standard deviation will be displayed.

## Uses of Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It is commonly used in various fields for:

- Analyzing data distribution: Standard deviation helps in understanding how spread out the values in a dataset are.
- Assessing variability: It provides insight into the consistency or variability of a dataset, which is important in fields like finance, manufacturing, and quality control.
- Making predictions: In statistics, standard deviation is often used in conjunction with the mean to make predictions and determine confidence intervals.
- Comparing datasets: Standard deviation allows for the comparison of variability between different datasets, helping in decision-making processes.

## Subjects Standard Deviation is Used In

Standard deviation is a fundamental concept in various school subjects and academic disciplines, including:

- **Mathematics**: It is extensively used in statistics, probability theory, and data analysis.
- **Physics**: Standard deviation helps physicists understand the distribution of measurements and uncertainties in experimental results.
- **Chemistry**: Chemists use standard deviation to analyze experimental data and assess the precision and accuracy of measurements.
- **Biology**: Biologists use standard deviation to analyze variability in biological data, such as the size of organisms or the results of experiments.
- **Economics**: Economists use standard deviation to analyze financial data, assess risk, and understand variability in economic indicators.
- **Psychology**: Psychologists use standard deviation to measure variability in psychological traits or behaviors and assess the reliability of psychological tests.
